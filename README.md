# About JWS One

![JWS One Logo](https://jasminews.uk/github/jwsone.svg)

JWS One Template provides you with a preset one column layout controlled using modern CSS properties.

The idea of the templates is that you can make changes to the content within the HTML File and it is then styled for you using the CSS provided.

All of this is covered within our tutorial that provides a step by step guide of the tasks and also the steps needed to publish/deploy to a hosting account.

Our [template page](https://jasminews.uk/templates/ "jasminews.uk/templates/") contains more information about what we ship as part of the JWS templates.

This template is built to be part of our JasmineWS Step by Step tutorial. Though if you know how to use HTML & CSS then you can use it as a starter for building your own website. We have some information on this on our [template page](https://jasminews.uk/templates/ "jasminews.uk/templates/").

## Getting Started with JWS One
We have defined all the steps for you to follow along in our [Doc's](https://jasminews.uk/docs/ "jasminews.uk/docs/"), which we believe will provide you with a clear guide to get building.
